        <article class="kc-content">
          <p>I am from Kansas City and I love everything this city has to offer. I have lived here ever since I was about 6 years old and I don't get sick of it. We have some of the best barbeque in the country from places such as Arthur Bryant's, Gate's, and Jack Stack BBQ. There is always something to do as well like going to try new pop up bars, attending a music festival, go to one of the sports teams games and we have a lot of lakes around the city for hanging out or just relaxing! This is a picture from the last Superbowl parade rally that the Chiefs won!</p>

        <article class="active-content">
          <p>Something about me is that I love being active whenever I get the chance. I have been weightlifting for almost 4 years now and I have recently taken up running for the past year and a half. This picture is of me finishing in 3rd place for a memorial day race last year! I also like to play a few sports recreationally such as tennis, socccer, basketball just to name a few, although soccer would probably be my favorite.</p>

        <article class="bruno-content"
          <p>This is bruno. Bruno is an english cocker spaniel and he is just over one year old. This is the first pet me or my family has ever had so we are super stoked to have him part of the family! He is really nice but sometimes shy at first. Once he gets comfortable with you he will want to play with you nonstop and will attack you with kisses! Bruno's favorite foods are pup cups and chicken with veggies!</p>
